hello-world!!!
am Quinevert, AKA MkQuinn
coding was not really my thing when i decided to do engineering,i love designing, so i knew graphics is my calling,then again i love machines and robots, so i said i would do AI, later, I found out AI was not for my country at the momment and graphic designing would fetch me less(even though i love it), i tried using blender,it was interesting, i made a yummy doughnut and was so happy,but then i loosed interest again.
am a confused human right?
yh i know.
it came time for my design project in school and i knew nothing on how to code, just some basic HTML and CSS trash.
my project was about creating an ecommerse site to sell my stuffs and that of some of my collegues(remember i said i love designing), i make sandals,bracelets ,earings and some nice stuffs using fabric,twin,beats, so i thought of selling them online to everyone.
funny right? yep i got that alot.
boom!!!
i heard about wordpress, i was happy, saying "yaaayyyy i wont code,i would just do drag n drop"
LOL!!!
straight away i started building my online shop
which was not bad , u know

(give me a minute please,i wil BRB)
